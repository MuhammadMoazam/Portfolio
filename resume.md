WORK EXPERIENCE
JavaScript Developer
Hubble42 (via Turing Platform), Lahore, Pakistan July 2025 – Present
Developed physics simulations using JavaScript (p5.js) to visualize computational experiments.
Performed video action annotation and captioning tasks to support fine-tuning of Claude and o4-mini multimodal models.
Assisted in function-calling pipelines that generated database-driven scenarios for AI agentic systems.
Worked on Dockerization of internal tools to streamline project environments and deployment.
Contributed to multiple AI-focused projects involving simulation, agentic workflows, and video annotation for model training.
MERN Stack Developer Intern
Web Media Voice, Punjab, Pakistan June 2024 – September 2024
Developed and maintained full-stack features using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for production web apps.
Built and refined RESTful APIs and modular services, improving code clarity and reducing response latency through optimized
queries and indexing.
PROJECTS
AI-Powered E-Commerce Autoscaling System (FYP). Developed a microservices-based store with an ML-driven autoscaling
engine using Decision Trees to predict resource needs from CPU/load signals. Led a 3-member team , focusing on backend
APIs, resource prediction, and cloud deployment. Integrated logging and monitoring tools to evaluate performance. Result:
Improved resource utilization efficiency by 20% under simulated peak loads.
Agentic Task Creation for AI Models. Designed and executed function-calling tasks that generated logical scenarios using
database inputs , improving the contextual reasoning capabilities of agentic AI models. Focus: AI workflow enhancement,
prompt design, database reasoning.
Video Annotation for Multimodal Training. Labeled actions and generated descriptive sentences for video datasets used in
fine-tuning multimodal models like Claude and o4-mini, ensuring data accuracy and relevance. Focus: Data annotation,
action recognition, multimodal AI training.
Travel Agency Web App. Designed a MERN-based travel booking platform supporting destination browsing, package
comparison, and secure bookings. Implemented backend workflows, authentication, and personalized dashboards with state
management in React. Added error handling and form validation for smoother UX. Result: Delivered a working system that
reduced booking errors by 15%.
SOFT SKILLS
Problem solving, teamwork, communication, leadership (led 3-member FYP team), adaptability, attention to detail.
